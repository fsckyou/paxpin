# PAX pins
## Wots all this then?
Dude, I wanted to make some kickass pins to have and trade at PAX East 2020. So, being an electrical engineer, I went the super nerdy route and made the pins using PCBs. You have stumbled across my designs.

## Can I rip this off for myself?
Yeah. Sure. They're inspired by games I didn't make, so I think that's fair.

## Do you sell these?
Nope.

## Will there be more pin designs?
Most definitely.

## How do I make one?
Well, load this up in KiCad and make whatever modifications you want. Then export the drill and Gerber files and send them over to a board fab house. I recommend using http://jlcpcb.com . When you get the boards in hand, program the ATTiny (if the design has one) and assemble the boards. Then attach a pin back using superglue wherever you think it makes sense.
